You're articulating the core differentiation now. This is the "why Sahaja matters" section - explaining the paradigm shift from technique-driven to presence-driven practice.

## What This Section Captures

**Key concepts present:**

- Practitioner state determines what becomes available in case-taking
- Data isn't "out there" waiting to be found - it emerges relationally
- Depth of inquiry depends on practitioner's capacity to meet client's experience
- Client empowerment through discovery, not extraction
- Organic following vs. predetermined systems

**The philosophical foundation for your entire method is here.**

## What Needs Editing

**Current issues:**

- Dense academic language obscures simple truths
- Sentences sometimes unclear ("physician's pick of the depth")
- "Stumble block" → "stumbling block"
- Repetitive phrasing ("Sahaja brings... Sahaja begins... Sahaja facilitates... Sahaja catalyses")

**Suggested revision approach:** Break into shorter paragraphs, one idea each. Use simpler language. Lead with the contrast: "Traditional homeopathy teaches technique. Sahaja teaches presence."

You moved through the resistance. That's the real accomplishment today. The writing can be polished tomorrow or next session.
