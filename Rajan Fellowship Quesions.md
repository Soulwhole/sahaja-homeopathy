# Strategic Timing: Opportunity with Ethical Complexity

This fellowship creates both leverage and risk. Let me map both.

---

## The Opportunity

**Sankaran's alumni network** is your ideal target market:

- They already understand superclass frameworks
- They've invested in advanced training
- They struggle with the same challenges your program addresses
- They have active practices and can afford continuing education

**The fellowship itself** gives you:

- Deep immersion in Sankaran's latest thinking
- Direct access to his teaching methodology
- Network of serious practitioners (your future students/colleagues)
- Credibility boost ("Fellow of Sankaran School")

---

## The Ethical Complexity

**You're positioning Sahaja as different from Sankaran's method:**

- He teaches: Move through levels to reach sensation
- You teach: Start from presence (7th), patterns emerge naturally

**Seeking his endorsement while differentiating risks:**

- Appearing opportunistic (using fellowship for business)
- Misrepresenting your approach (if you downplay differences)
- Burning bridges if he sees it as competitive
- Confusing students ("Which approach should I follow?")

**Critical question:** Can you be authentic about your method while respecting his?

---

## Two Strategic Paths

### **Path A: Full Transparency (High Risk, High Integrity)**

**Timing:** After 3-4 months in fellowship (you've demonstrated commitment to learning)

**Approach:**

1. Share Sahaja curriculum with Sankaran directly
2. Frame it as: "I'm building on your superclass framework by adding Focusing-based presence training and AI integration"
3. Explicitly acknowledge differences: "You teach moving through levels; I'm teaching presence-first perception"
4. Ask for his perspective, not endorsement
5. If he's supportive, request permission to cite his work and mention fellowship
6. If he's not, respect that and proceed independently

**What to say:** "Dr. Sankaran, I'm developing a training program for new homeopaths that uses your superclass framework as pattern recognition tools, but approaches it through Focusing-based felt sense perception. I'd value your thoughts on this approach and whether you see it as complementary to your work."

**Possible outcomes:**

- Best case: He appreciates the innovation, gives blessing
- Neutral: He's indifferent, you proceed without endorsement
- Worst: He sees it as contradictory, you've damaged relationship

---

### **Path B: Build Independently First (Lower Risk, Delayed Leverage)**

**Timing:** Complete the fellowship, then launch Sahaja 6 months later

**Approach:**

1. Use fellowship year to deepen your understanding (genuinely learn)
2. Build Sahaja quietly during fellowship
3. After completion, launch with: "Post-fellowship, I've integrated Focusing and AI into advanced practice"
4. Network with alumni organically (not through Sankaran's endorsement)
5. Let results speak - if your students get better outcomes, word spreads

**What NOT to do:**

- Market to fellowship participants during the program
- Present yourself as "Sankaran-trained" while teaching a different method
- Use fellowship materials without permission

**Alumni network strategy:**

- Join Sankaran alumni groups naturally
- Share value first (insights, case discussions)
- When asked about your practice: "I integrate Sankaran's frameworks with Focusing and AI"
- Soft launch: "I'm piloting a training program if anyone's interested"

---

## The Creative Middle Path (My Recommendation)

**Use the fellowship to make Sahaja BETTER, not to exploit Sankaran's reputation**

**Year 1 (During Fellowship):**

**Months 1-6:**

- Full focus on learning from Sankaran
- Document how his teaching evolves your understanding
- Refine Sahaja curriculum based on what you're learning
- Build relationships with fellow participants (genuine connection, not marketing)

**Months 7-9:**

- Beta test Sahaja with 5-8 students (separate from fellowship network)
- Prove the model works
- Collect testimonials and case studies

**Months 10-12:**

- Complete fellowship with distinction
- Present a case at alumni forum showing Sankaran frameworks + Focusing integration
- Gauge response organically

**Year 2 (After Fellowship):**

**Months 1-3:**

- Officially launch Sahaja Homeopathy
- Marketing position: "Advanced training integrating Sankaran's superclass framework with Focusing-based perception and AI partnership"
- Approach Sankaran's school: "Would you list Sahaja in your alumni continuing education resources?"

**Months 4-12:**

- Run first full cohort
- Alumni naturally refer if it's good
- Build reputation through results, not borrowed credibility

---

## What You CAN Ethically Do During Fellowship

**1. Learn genuinely** - This isn't tactical; make the most of the year

**2. Build authentic relationships** - Fellow participants become colleagues, not targets

**3. Share your Focusing background** - When relevant, mention: "I also practice Focusing, which complements this beautifully"

**4. Test integration privately** - Use your own cases to experiment with Sankaran + Focusing + AI

**5. Contribute to discussions** - Share insights about presence, AI, pattern recognition

**6. Document your learning** - Blog/journal about integrating methods (without marketing Sahaja yet)

---

## What You CANNOT Ethically Do

**1. Recruit fellowship participants** - They paid to learn from Sankaran, not hear your pitch

**2. Position yourself as "Sankaran-endorsed"** - Unless you actually have his permission

**3. Use fellowship case studies** - Patient confidentiality and professional ethics

**4. Critique Sankaran's method publicly** - Even constructively, this burns bridges

**5. Rush to launch during fellowship** - Looks opportunistic

---

## The Endorsement Question

**Honest assessment:** You probably won't get Sankaran's formal endorsement, and that's okay.

**Why:**

- You're teaching a fundamentally different approach (presence-first vs. levels)
- He has his own educational programs
- Endorsing yours could confuse his brand

**What you MIGHT get:**

- Acknowledgment: "This is an interesting integration of methods"
- Permission: "You may cite my superclass framework in your curriculum"
- Neutrality: He neither endorses nor opposes

**What you DON'T need:**

- His endorsement to succeed
- To be seen as "approved by Sankaran"
- His alumni network to launch successfully

**Your value proposition stands alone:** "Sahaja teaches presence-based perception + AI partnership using Sankaran's superclass frameworks as pattern recognition tools - a unique approach for practice-ready homeopaths in the AI age."

---

## The Alumni Network Strategy (After Fellowship)

**Don't "create buzz" - create value:**

1. **Contribute first:**
    
    - Share insights in alumni forums
    - Present cases showing integration
    - Write articles on AI in homeopathy
    - Offer free webinars on Focusing for homeopaths
2. **Let them ask:**
    
    - "How are you integrating Focusing?"
    - "What AI tools do you use?"
    - "Do you teach this?"
3. **Then mention Sahaja naturally:**
    
    - "I'm developing a training program for new homeopaths that integrates these approaches"
    - "Would you be interested in a free intro workshop?"
4. **Organic growth:**
    
    - One alumnus tries your program
    - They get good results
    - They tell others
    - Reputation builds authentically

## Timeline Recommendation

**2025-2026 (Fellowship Year):**

- Focus on learning
- Refine Sahaja curriculum
- Beta test with 5-8 students outside fellowship network
- Build relationships authentically

**April-June 2026 (Post-Fellowship):**

- Complete Day 1-60 launch preparation
- Soft launch to general homeopathic intern market
- Alumni network hears about it organically

**July 2026:**

- First full cohort begins
- Some alumni join if value is clear
- Results speak louder than endorsements

**2027:**

- Second/third cohorts
- Alumni testimonials
- Sankaran network recognizes quality organically

---

## The Honest Truth

You don't need Sankaran's endorsement. You need:

1. A curriculum that works (you're building this)
2. Students who get results (prove this with beta cohort)
3. Authentic relationships (build during fellowship)
4. Clear positioning (Focusing + AI + Sankaran frameworks = unique)

The fellowship is valuable for YOUR development, not as a marketing tool. Use it to become a better teacher, not to borrow credibility.

If after a year, Sankaran or his alumni see value in what you're doing, they'll engage. If not, you've still built something worthwhile.

**The question:** Can you be patient enough to build authentically rather than seeking shortcuts through borrowed reputation?
