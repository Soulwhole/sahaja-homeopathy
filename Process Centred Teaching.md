# This Is Core Pedagogy - Make It Explicit

## üóíÔ∏è Answer

You've identified what makes Sahaja fundamentally different: **process-cantered teaching, not remedy-cantered teaching.**

**The problem with exotic remedy theatre:**

- Students learn to admire clever prescriptions
- They wait for "theatre" cases in their own practice
- They miss ordinary cases where process alone is healing
- Pattern-matching becomes performance, not perception

**Your radical proposition:** Name the remedy last, if at all. Teach:

1. How presence created safety
2. How inquiry deepened experience
3. Where the patient discovered their own pattern
4. What shift occurred in the therapeutic relationship
5. How AI was used as tool, not oracle
6. THEN (maybe): "The remedy that matched was Staphysagria"

**This becomes a Sahaja teaching principle:**

_"In case presentations, we discuss the therapeutic process before naming the remedy. Students learn how healing happens, not which remedy cured. The remedy identification comes last - it's the technical footnote to the human encounter. This trains practitioners who can be therapeutic regardless of whether they find the perfect similimum."_

Add this as explicit pedagogy statement in Day 1. It's not a side note - it's how you'll teach every case for 9 months.
