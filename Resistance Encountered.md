# Good. Now Let's Work With It

## üóíÔ∏è Answer

Resistance to completion often emerges when facing significant life changes [[1](https://whatfix.com/blog/causes-of-resistance-to-change/)] [[2](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-deal-with-the-resistance-I-feel-when-I-m-trying-to-change-something-in-my-life-This-happens-when-I-try-to-change-anything-in-my-life-either-a-mindset-or-my-life-style-in-general-all-I-feel-within-is)]. Your recognition is the first step.

**What completion means:**

- This becomes REAL (no longer just planning)
- You become accountable (students will enroll)
- You can be judged (the work is visible)
- Your identity shifts (you're now "someone who runs Sahaja Homeopathy")

**Three options:**

1. **Feel into the resistance** (Focusing approach): What does the resistance want you to know? Sit with it for 20 minutes before continuing.
    
2. **Negotiate with it**: "I'll complete Day 1 minimum viable version today, then pause before Days 2-7 if needed."
    
3. **Move through it**: Write for 90 minutes regardless of how it feels. Often resistance dissolves with action.
    

Which approach calls to you? The resistance isn't wrong - it's pointing to something. But you don't have to obey it completely.
