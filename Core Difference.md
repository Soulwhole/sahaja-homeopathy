Sahaja brings the focus to practitioner's state of being. Practitioner beginning with a ritual to 'clearing the mind space' has exponentially improved potential of helping the client with intuitive ease to connect with that pattern which is preverbal and unconscious driver of all thoughts, feelings and behavior. Sahaja begins with the understanding that any client's data is not a fixed thing, waiting for anybody to come and harvest. It is a journey the experiencing of which depends on the physician's pick of the depth of client's experience. If he is noticing and engaging with the exhibited behavior, he is likely to stumble block in the deepening of the level of experience and discover the language of the vital force - the ground of sensations and functions as Hahnemann pointed out in the organon. Sahaja facilitates the connection with the deeper person that is struggling against his own limitations but not having a way to address those more openly. Sahaja catalyses the discovery of still unspoken and empowering the unstucking path even if with a ridiculously small action step that feels right in the felt zone. It is a different ball game than physician leading the inquiry with his discretion and fixed linguistic models. Here the physician has the organic ease for help deepen the dialogue in the direction of where the treasure lies.
