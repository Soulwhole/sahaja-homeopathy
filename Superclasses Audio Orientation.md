Beautiful — here’s a **guided script version** of your experiment-story.  
It’s written so you can _read it aloud slowly_ during a workshop or webinar, allowing participants to _feel into_ the experience before revealing the six superclasses.  
Pace notes and pauses are included in parentheses.

## 🌙 **Guided Experiment: The Night of Instincts**

_(Soft, calm voice — slow pace)_

Let’s take a few moments to do a simple inner experiment.  
It’s designed to help you directly sense the core patterns of the six **superclasses** — the deep, instinctive ways in which we meet threat, uncertainty, or fear.

Please sit comfortably…  
Let your eyes close.  
Take a deep breath in… and slowly exhale.  
(Pause)

Now — imagine it’s night.  
You are in bed, lying quietly, half-asleep.  
The house is still. The air feels gentle and familiar.  
Everything seems calm.  
(Pause 5 seconds)

Then… a sound.  
Somewhere in the house.  
Maybe a faint creak of a door, a rustle in another room…  
(Pause 5 seconds)

You’re not sure what it was.  
You listen.  
Another sound follows — a little louder this time.  
(Pause 5 seconds)

Your body wakes up.  
Your heartbeat quickens.  
You realize someone — or something — might be inside.  
(Pause)

Don’t think.  
Don’t reason.  
Just _feel_.  
Notice the very first thing that happens inside you — that spontaneous, instinctive movement before thought arrives.  
(Pause 10 seconds)

Do you find yourself wanting to **pull the blanket over your head**, to hide, to make yourself invisible, to shut out all sound and sight?  
(Pause 5 seconds)

Or do you **peek out carefully**, wanting to see what’s happening, but ready to quickly retreat and close yourself off if danger seems near?  
(Pause 5 seconds)

Maybe you feel the urge to **draw a boundary**, a sense that — “No one must cross this line!” — wanting to create a protective wall around you.  
(Pause 5 seconds)

Perhaps your instinct is to **reach for help** — to call someone, to alert the police, to find safety through connection and support.  
(Pause 5 seconds)

Or you may feel **stuck**, unable to move, but desperate to get out — to escape somehow, to break free.  
(Pause 5 seconds)

Or… a powerful surge of energy may rise within you — the **fight-or-flight** impulse — wanting to grab something, confront, defend, or attack.  
(Pause 10 seconds)

Whatever your first response was —  
just notice it.  
Don’t judge it, don’t change it.  
Simply stay with it, as if you are watching yourself from outside, seeing how your whole being moves in the face of sudden threat.  
(Pause)

Now slowly open your eyes…  
and take a deep breath.  
(Short pause)

### 🜂 **Six Archetypal Patterns — The Superclasses**

Over hundreds of such experiments, people’s instinctive responses tend to cluster into six distinct patterns —  
six _superclasses_ of perception and reaction:

1. **Withdrawing inward** — isolating, covering, shutting eyes and ears.
    
2. **Cautious peeking** — looking briefly, then retreating.
    
3. **Boundary-making** — setting a line no one should cross.
    
4. **Seeking protection** — calling or reaching for help.
    
5. **Escaping confinement** — feeling trapped and needing to get out.
    
6. **Fighting back** — reacting with aggression or defense.
    

Each superclass reveals a **fundamental orientation** — a way our system meets the world when we feel threatened or vulnerable.

When we recognize which dynamic lives most strongly in a person — whether patient, friend, or ourselves — we begin to see the deeper architecture of their experience.  
This becomes the first stop in understanding the _inner landscape_ of the case.

So take a moment now.  
Look at the six patterns.  
Feel which one resonates with your own spontaneous response tonight.  
Not what you _think_ you should do — but what your _body_ and _instinct_ showed you.

That’s your entry point —  
the window into your personal **superclass orientation**.

_(Soft closing tone)_  
When we enter case-taking from this place — not of intellect, but of direct sensing — the process becomes alive, relational, and fulfilling.  
Here, perception deepens.  
And the similimum begins to reveal itself.

Would you like me to prepare a **visual slide sequence or voiceover script** (e.g., for a live workshop, video, or Canva presentation) to accompany this — with pacing, fade-in text, and background tone suggestions? That would make it a very immersive learning experience.
