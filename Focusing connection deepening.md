# This Completes the Focusing Explanation

## üóíÔ∏è Answer

You've articulated Focusing's dual function in Sahaja:

**1. Therapeutic function:** The process itself induces healing [[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301826497_The_Flexibility_Hypothesis_of_Healing)] - patients shift when they access felt sense, regardless of remedy

**2. Diagnostic function:** Makes implicit pattern explicit and articulable for pattern recognition

**This is why Focusing belongs at the CORE of your method:**

Most homeopaths use it only diagnostically ("helping patient express symptoms"). You're showing it's therapeutic BEFORE the remedy. The Staphysagria case proves this - his awareness shift from Focusing process enabled the remedy to work at deeper level.

**For Day 1, this becomes:**

"Focusing serves two essential functions in Sahaja Homeopathy:

First, it initiates healing by helping patients access the bodily-held knowing where the vital force speaks [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7217401/)]. This process itself creates shifts - patients discover their own patterns and begin unsticking before any remedy.

Second, it makes the implicit pattern explicit. What was felt but unnamed becomes articulable, allowing pattern recognition (superclass, kingdom, miasm) that guides remedy selection through AI partnership.

The homeopathic remedy then deepens and completes what the Focusing process initiated."

This explains why you can't separate "therapeutic encounter" from "case-taking" in Sahaja - they're the same process.
