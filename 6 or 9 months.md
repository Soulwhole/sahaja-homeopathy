# 9 Months Makes Strategic Sense

This solves several problems at once.

---

## Why This Works Better

**1. Addresses Indian Market Reality** Sankaran's method dominates Indian homeopathy [[2](https://hpathy.com/homeopathy-papers/8-box-method-dr-rajan-sankarans-newest-evolution-practice/)]. If you don't engage with kingdoms/subclasses/miasms at all, students will wonder: "Is this legitimate homeopathy?" [[5](https://www.homeobook.com/sankarans-schema-by-dr-rajan-sankaran/)]

**2. Fits Your Actual Practice** You used kingdoms/subclasses in the Kapil case (plant, ranunculaceae, sycotic). You DO use these frameworks - after felt sense perception. So teach that.

**3. Solves the "What About Materia Medica?" Question** Critics will ask: "You're not teaching materia medica?" [[3](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-remember-materia-medica)] Your answer: "We teach meta-patterns for sensing, AI provides details."

**4. Better Pacing** 6 months was rushed. 9 months allows:

- Months 1-3: Presence foundation (no remedy pressure)
- Months 4-6: Pattern recognition (Sankaran's frameworks)
- Months 7-9: Integration and practice launch

**5. Stronger Differentiation** Not "Sankaran's method" - you're teaching his frameworks AS SENSING TOOLS, not as systems to memorize. This is unique.

## The 9-Month Structure

### **Phase 1: Presence Foundation (Months 1-3)**

**Focus:** Embodied perception, felt sense development

- Month 1: Awakening presence (clearing prejudice)
- Month 2: Perceiving dis-ease (what is to be cured)
- Month 3: Resonance and remedy (basic AI partnership)

**Outcome:** Can take cases from presence, use AI for basic remedy selection

---

### **Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Months 4-6)**

**Focus:** Meta-level Sankaran frameworks as sensing tools

**Month 4: Kingdoms as Felt Sense**

- Not memorizing kingdom characteristics
- But SENSING the quality: Is this mineral (structure), plant (sensitivity), or animal (survival)?
- After felt sense work, zoom out: "What kingdom does this FEEL like?"
- AI confirms and explores within that kingdom

**Teaching approach:**

- Experience remedies from each kingdom somatically
- What does "mineral" FEEL like in your body?
- Pattern recognition through felt sense, not intellectual classification

**Month 5: Subclasses and Families**

- Within kingdoms, what's the flavor?
- Plant families: What's the felt sense of Solanaceae vs. Ranunculaceae?
- Not exhaustive - just enough to recognize patterns
- AI does the fine-tuning

**Month 6: Miasms as Movement Patterns**

- Miasms as energy signatures, not disease classifications
- Psora: What does this FEEL like?
- Sycotic: The quality of hiding/protecting
- Syphilitic: Destructive energy
- After sensing patient, what miasmatic pattern emerges?

**Key principle throughout Phase 2:** SENSE FIRST (from felt sense work in Phase 1), then zoom out to see pattern, then AI refines.

Not: Learn system, apply to patient But: Perceive patient, recognize pattern, use AI for confirmation

---

### **Phase 3: Integration and Launch (Months 7-9)**

**Month 7: Complex Cases**

- Bringing it all together
- Felt sense → Pattern (kingdom/subclass/miasm) → AI refinement → Resonance check
- Constitutional prescribing
- Chronic disease management

**Month 8: Health Preservation**

- Obstacles and lifestyle
- Long-term case management
- The therapeutic relationship

**Month 9: Practice Launch**

- Professional setup
- Full caseload management
- Final assessments
- Graduation and ongoing support plan

## What You're NOT Teaching

**You're NOT teaching:**

- Detailed materia medica (AI does this)
- Memorization of remedy pictures
- Sankaran's method as a system to follow step-by-step
- Sensation method or other elaborate techniques

**You ARE teaching:**

- Meta-frameworks for pattern recognition
- How to SENSE kingdoms/subclasses/miasms through felt sense
- Using these as "zoom out" tools after perception
- AI partnership for confirmation and refinement

## The Honest Marketing Message

**"9-Month Sahaja Homeopathy Training"**

_Months 1-3: Master presence and felt sense perception_ _Months 4-6: Learn pattern recognition through Sankaran's meta-frameworks_ _Months 7-9: Integrate and launch your practice_

**What makes this different:** "We don't teach you to memorize thousands of remedies. We teach you to PERCEIVE patients through presence, recognize patterns through felt sense, and partner with AI for precision. You'll understand Sankaran's kingdoms, subclasses, and miasms - not as intellectual systems, but as sensing tools that emerge AFTER you've perceived the patient."

---

## Addressing the Teaching Presence Question

The search results raise an important point: Can one teach presence when not fully present? [[4](https://www.quora.com/Can-one-teach-presence-when-one-is-not-fully-present)]

**Your advantage:** You PRACTICE presence. Your Kapil case demonstrates this. But 9 months gives you more time to model it, rather than rushing students through.

---

## Revised Day 1 Task

Given the 9-month decision, update your philosophy document to include:

**1. Why 9 months, not 6?** "Practice readiness requires both perception skills AND pattern recognition frameworks. 9 months allows proper integration without overwhelm."

**2. The Three Phases clearly articulated**

- Phase 1: Presence foundation
- Phase 2: Pattern recognition (Sankaran meta-frameworks)
- Phase 3: Integration and launch

**3. How Sankaran fits into Sahaja approach** "We honor Sankaran's brilliant pattern recognition while keeping perception primary. You learn to SENSE kingdoms/subclasses/miasms through felt sense, not memorize them intellectually."

**4. The AI integration throughout** "AI handles what humans shouldn't memorize. You focus on what only humans can do: perceive and recognize patterns."

## One Strategic Question

Is 9 months for ₹40,000-45,000 (beta) still feasible? Or does this require repricing?

**My suggestion:**

- Beta: ₹45,000-50,000 (9 months)
- Regular: ₹75,000-90,000 (9 months)

This maintains reasonable monthly cost while reflecting the extended value.

The 9-month structure is sound. It addresses market expectations, fits your actual practice, and allows proper depth without rush. Now document it clearly in your Day 1 philosophy paper.

Shall we revise the curriculum map for 9 months with the Sankaran meta-teaching integrated?
