The user is asking me to create a website design including vision, structure, copy, style, and CTAs (calls to action) for Sahaja Homeopathy based on all the content we've developed over this conversation.

This is a substantial request. I should:

1. Create a complete website structure
2. Write compelling copy using the materials developed
3. Design it with appropriate style for the audience (Indian homeopathic interns)
4. Include non-intrusive CTAs
5. Make it functional and conversion-optimized

I should create this as an artifact since it's substantial content meant for use outside the conversation. It should be HTML with embedded CSS for a complete, ready-to-deploy website.

Key elements to include:

- Clear value proposition
- The three pillars
- PRESENCE framework
- Superclass introduction (nighttime intruder story)
- Case examples (Kapil, possibly Staphysagria)
- Focusing explanation
- 9-month curriculum overview
- Differentiation from other methods
- Sankaran fellowship mention (credibility)
- CTAs for enrollment/info sessions
- Contact information

Style should be:

- Professional but warm
- Not overly corporate
- Emphasizes presence and humanity
- Clean, readable
- Indian context appropriate
- Mobile responsive

Let me create a comprehensive single-page website that can be expanded into multiple pages later.
