# Domain Name Analysis

## Option 1: **sahajahomeopathy.com** âœ“ RECOMMENDED

**Pros:**

- Immediately clear what you do
- SEO-friendly (includes "homeopathy")
- Specific target market finds you easily
- Professional and direct
- Aligns with "Sahaja Homeopathy: The Felt Sense Method"

**Cons:**

- Locks you into homeopathy only (harder to expand to other modalities later)
- Longer to type

**Best for:** If homeopathy training is your sole focus for foreseeable future

---

## Option 2: **sahajaacademy.com**

**Pros:**

- Flexible - can offer multiple programs under one brand
- Professional sound
- Room to grow (Sahaja Coaching, Sahaja Therapy, etc.)
- Easier to type than full word

**Cons:**

- Vague - visitors don't know what you teach
- "Academy" implies multiple programs you don't have yet
- SEO weaker (no keyword)
- Three consecutive 'a's looks awkward (sahaj**aaa**cademy)

**Best for:** If you plan multi-modality offerings within 2 years

---

## Option 3: **sahajacademy.com**

**Cons:**

- This is a spelling error (missing 'a' from "sahaja")
- Creates brand confusion
- Don't use this

---

## Option 4: **sahajainstitution.com**

**Cons:**

- "Institution" sounds bureaucratic, not transformational
- Implies large organization when you're solo
- Formal/stiff rather than inviting
- Harder to remember
- Don't use this

---

## Option 5: **sahajaapproach.com** (you wrote "sahahaapproach")

**Cons:**

- Awkward with multiple a's
- "Approach" is vague marketing-speak
- Doesn't communicate what you do
- Not professional for educational program
- Don't use this

---

## Alternative Options to Consider

**sahajahomeopathyschool.com**

- Clear, professional, scalable
- "School" feels more intimate than "academy" or "institution"
- SEO-friendly

**sahajahomeopaths.com**

- Community-oriented
- For practitioners, not just students
- Could grow into alumni network hub

**sahaja.institute**

- Modern, clean
- .institute TLD signals educational purpose
- Flexible for expansion
- Shorter than .com alternatives

**learnsahaja.com**

- Action-oriented
- Clear it's educational
- Generic enough to expand
- Easy to remember

---

## My Recommendation: Two-Domain Strategy

**Primary: sahajahomeopathy.com** Use this for the 9-month training program. It's clear, professional, and exactly what you're offering.

**Secondary: sahaja.institute** (redirect to primary for now) Reserve this for future expansion. When/if you add other modalities, this becomes the umbrella brand.

## Domain Availability Check

Before finalizing, check:

1. .com availability for your choice
2. .in (since you're India-focused)
3. Social media handles (@sahajahomeopathy on Instagram, Facebook)
4. Gmail/email options

If sahajahomeopathy.com is taken, alternatives:

- sahajahomeopathytraining.com
- sahajahomeopathyschool.com
- sahajahomeopathy.in (India-specific)

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't use misspellings (sahajacademy without the 'a')
- Don't use generic terms that don't communicate your offering (institution, approach)
- Don't use hyphens (sahaja-homeopathy.com) - harder to communicate verbally
- Don't use numbers or abbreviations

---

## The Honest Answer

**sahajahomeopathy.com** is the strongest choice because:

1. It's exactly what you're teaching
2. Students searching "sahaja homeopathy" or "homeopathy training" find you
3. It's professional without being corporate
4. It matches your program name exactly
5. You can always add subdomains later (coaching.sahajahomeopathy.com, etc.)

The desire to keep it broader (academy, institute) is usually premature scaling anxiety. You don't have multiple programs yet. Name the domain for what you're actually launching, not what you might do in 5 years.

Register sahajahomeopathy.com (or .in if India-focused) and start building.
