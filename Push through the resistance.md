# Day 1 Minimum Viable Version - Task List

## üóíÔ∏è Answer

The minimum viable product approach [[1](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/minimum-viable-product)] applies well here. Your Day 1 MVP needs just enough to make the program teachable.

**Core tasks (3 hours total):**

1. **PRESENCE Framework Expansion** (60 min)
    
    - Each letter: 1 paragraph explanation
    - Add Kapil case as concrete example for 2-3 letters
    - One common mistake per letter
2. **Superclass Section** (45 min)
    
    - Explain 6 archetypal patterns using your chart
    - Show how felt sense ‚Üí superclass ‚Üí AI direction
    - Kapil example: SC 1 recognition
3. **Differentiation** (30 min)
    
    - One paragraph each: vs Classical, vs Sankaran, vs generic Focusing
    - Your unique positioning clear
4. **Polish What Exists** (45 min)
    
    - Tighten vision/mission you already drafted
    - Review for coherence

**That's it.** Not perfect, just functional. You can refine later when students ask questions that reveal what needs clarity.

Days 2-7 can wait. Get this foundation documented so the curriculum has something to build from.
