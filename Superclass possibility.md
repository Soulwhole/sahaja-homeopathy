# Revised Phase 2: Better Pedagogical Progression

Your refinement is more sophisticated. Starting with superclasses gives the organizing framework before kingdom differentiation, and miasms as the final layer makes logical sense.

## **PHASE 2 REVISED: PATTERN RECOGNITION (Months 4-6)**

### **MONTH 4: SUPERCLASS PATTERNS**

_Theme: The Organizing Framework_

**Week 13: Introduction to Superclasses**

- What are superclasses? (Sankaran's organizing principle)
- Beyond kingdoms: The finer patterns within
- For minerals: Periodic table rows/series as felt sense
- For plants: Major botanical classifications
- For animals: Systematic groupings
- Not memorization - sensing the organizing pattern
- **Assignment:** Study superclass framework overview
- **Deliverable:** Superclass sensing journal

**Week 14: Mineral Superclasses (Rows/Series)**

- Row 1-7: What does each ROW feel like?
- Series 1-18: The movement through series
- After patient felt sense: Which row/series does this feel like?
- AI refines within that superclass
- **Assignment:** 2 cases sensing mineral row/series
- **Deliverable:** Mineral superclass cases

**Week 15: Plant Superclasses (Major Classifications)**

- Dicots vs. Monocots: The felt difference
- Major plant groupings (not exhaustive - key patterns)
- What's the organizing principle that emerges from felt sense?
- **Assignment:** 2 plant superclass cases
- **Deliverable:** Plant classification sensing

**Week 16: Animal Superclasses**

- Vertebrates vs. Invertebrates
- Major animal groupings by evolutionary pattern
- The felt sense of different animal organizations
- **Assignment:** 2 animal superclass cases
- **Portfolio:** 6 cases showing superclass sensing
- **Reflection:** "How superclass framework helps pattern recognition"

**Month 4 Outcome:** Understand organizing frameworks across all remedies, can sense which superclass pattern emerges from felt sense work

---

### **MONTH 5: KINGDOM DIFFERENTIATION**

_Theme: Mineral, Plant, or Animal?_

**Week 17: The Three Kingdoms Review**

- Now that superclasses understood, return to kingdoms with depth
- Mineral: Structure, order, identity
- Plant: Sensitivity, relationship, environment
- Animal: Survival, competition, prey/predator
- Integration with superclass knowledge

**Week 18: Kingdom Sensing in Practice**

- After felt sense work: Which kingdom?
- Then: Which superclass within that kingdom?
- AI explores that specific area
- **Assignment:** 3 cases with full kingdom → superclass pathway
- **Deliverable:** Kingdom differentiation cases

**Week 19: Difficult Differentials**

- When kingdom isn't immediately clear
- Mixed patterns (plant-animal, mineral-plant interface)
- Using multiple frameworks simultaneously
- Staying tentative, letting AI suggest alternatives
- **Assignment:** 2 complex kingdom differential cases
- **Deliverable:** Complex differentiation documentation

**Week 20: Integration & Mastery**

- Full process: Felt sense → Superclass emerges → Kingdom clarified → AI refines
- 4 supervised cases demonstrating mastery
- **Portfolio:** 4 comprehensive cases showing superclass → kingdom → AI partnership
- **Peer teaching:** Present one successful case to cohort

**Month 5 Outcome:** Can differentiate kingdoms with confidence, integrate with superclass sensing, use both as AI direction tools

### **MONTH 6: MIASM SENSING**

_Theme: The Energetic Layer_

**Week 21: Miasmatic Understanding**

- Miasms cut across all kingdoms/superclasses [[2](https://www.scribd.com/document/576631539/Genetic-Materia-Medica-Vol-1-By-Parful-Vijayakar-Typed-PDF)]
- Not disease classification - energetic movement patterns
- Hahnemann's original insight revisited [[3](https://www.scribd.com/document/702870694/Harimohan-Choudhury-Indications-of-Miasms-B-Jain-Pub-Pvt-Ltd-2005)]
- Psora, Sycosis, Syphilis as archetypal movements
- **Assignment:** Study miasms through felt sense
- **Deliverable:** Miasm sensing journal

**Week 22: Psora - The Struggle**

- Felt sense of psoric energy: "Not enough," struggle, compensation
- Can appear in any kingdom/superclass
- After all other sensing: What's the miasmatic flavor?
- **Assignment:** 2 psora-dominant cases across different kingdoms
- **Deliverable:** Psoric pattern documentation

**Week 23: Sycosis & Syphilis**

- Sycosis: Hiding, protecting, covering
- Syphilis: Destructive energy, hopelessness
- Mixed miasmatic pictures (most common)
- Integration with kingdom/superclass
- **Assignment:** 2 sycotic, 2 syphilitic cases
- **Deliverable:** Miasmatic pattern cases

**Week 24: Complete Integration**

- Full framework: Felt sense → Superclass → Kingdom → Miasm → AI refinement → Resonance
- All layers working together
- Not linear steps - simultaneous sensing
- **Assignment:** 3 cases using complete framework
- **Portfolio:** 3 comprehensive cases showing all layers
- **Phase 2 Final Assessment:** Present one case demonstrating mastery of all pattern recognition tools

**Month 6 Outcome:** Can sense miasmatic patterns as additional layer, full pattern recognition framework integrated, ready for advanced practice

## Why This Progression Works Better

**Superclass → Kingdom → Miasm makes pedagogical sense because:**

1. **Superclass first** gives students the organizing map before getting lost in kingdoms
2. **Kingdom differentiation** becomes easier when they already understand superclasses
3. **Miasms last** as the most abstract layer - students need solid grounding in concrete patterns first
4. **Each builds on previous** rather than parallel learning

Your clinical experience shows in this structure. This is how pattern recognition actually develops in practice.

## Day 1 Task Update

Given this refinement, your Day 1 documentation should include:

**Phase 2 Teaching Philosophy:** "We teach pattern recognition in order of increasing abstraction: Superclass frameworks provide the organizing map, kingdom differentiation adds specificity, and miasmatic sensing reveals the deepest energetic layer. Students build upward from concrete to abstract, always grounding in felt sense first."

This curriculum is now solid. Shall we proceed with completing Day 1 documentation, or do you want to refine anything else first?
