## What Remains for Tomorrow (Day 1 Completion)

**Priority 1: Expand PRESENCE framework** (1-1.5 hours)

- Use Kapil case as example for each letter
- Add teaching story for at least 3-4 letters
- Note common mistakes students make
		**Sahaja Homeopathy - Felt Sense Method
		- 3 Pillars of Sahaja Homeopathy
			- PRESENCE First
			- HumanFirst
			- AI-Synergy
			
	- PRESENCE is a meaningful acronym to capture the whole process of Sahaja homeopathy where each letter symbolizes one important aspect/step of it.
		- P = Pause
			- Pause makes sure to have the session observation from an unprejudiced state of awareness. Before entering into the consultation, taking few moments to identify what all occupies the mind in the moment. It may be something unrelated with the case that is waiting outside, or an anxiety, pressure or pre-judgement made from whatever preceded before.
			- Scanning the body from head to toe, acknowledging any muscular tension, tightness or butterflies. Allowing couple of fulfilling breaths in and out and making space to listen to whatever they have to convey, and gently putting them aside, knowing fairly well that you can collect them back once done with the session.
			- Our guided sessions will make this practical and fun to do, clearing-the-space activity a part of the pre-session ritual.
		- R = Resonance
			- Resonance makes sure to remind that you are here not to listen to just the words but much more than that. You are here to resonate with the energy and to the deeper intended meaning behind the words. When you hear something, the words, the intonation, the force, the body language and facial expressions, you take a moment, even a second is good enough and check inside if you can feel what the client was wanting to say. Most of the time, it will be a 'yeah, i understand'. This silent inner affirmation is the solid way to not lose the connection with the client and keep resonating with the unfolding story and the person telling the story.
		- E = Exploration
			- This is the invitation for a deep adventure, the treasure hunt - to go to the depth of patient's experience where the voice of vital force is uncontaminated and clear. This becomes possible when you trust the process, when you trust that the vital force is the essence of the life and waiting to communicate its version to you when you go to the place where it speaks the language of sensations and functions, the felt zone. Realize that you can not go there yourself, you have to use the patient's compass. She must be behind the steering wheel but you need to guide her to not go on habitual escape routes but rather keep going deeper even if it seems unfamiliar and not comfortable. Your human presence, and compassionate curiosity will make it easier and worthwhile for your companion.
		- S = Synthesis
			- This needs you to step back from the together-felt-space and ask yourself - what is the big picture that is unfolding and than finding resonating words, phrases, images or parables.
			- Once you have the handle, give it back to the client and check its accuracy. Don't be invested in your find. Feel happy if you get corrected. And thus, one stroke at a time, you draw the picture of the gestalt of what unfolds.
			- This is the data you give to your AI companion to facilitate your further journey and the analysis of pattern.
			- We can see that Synthesis has 3 substeps
				- Stepping back to acknowledge the bigger picture
				- Reflecting back and being corrected
				- Sharing the confirmed data with the AI partner
		- E = Eliminate
			- This E respects the aph 3 of organon where Hahnemann cautions that the remedy alone is often not the whole prescription of a true healer. You need to identify and eliminate the obstacles in the path of the healing. The true-north remains the same. You let your human companion (your client) to stay in the driver's seat and check from the inner guide that speaks from the felt-zone - what maybe the worst that is making life so hard. This can be a powerful addition to the gestalt picture on one hand, and on the other the empowerment of the client to own the process of healing.
		- N = Nurture
			- This is the other side of the earlier step. In the previous step we learned to eliminate the obstacle, and the Nurture is the felt-sense guided small step that is possible to make life even a little better
		- C = Continue
			- Continue is recognition that healing is a journey and most of your patients will come back for follow up. Continue reminds you to freshly allow PRESENCE to be your first angel in facilitating the healing of the other human being who has chosen you as a partner in this sacred journey.
		- E = Evolve
			- Evolve is the reminder that the path of the homeopathic healer is a life-long journey where you must remember to keep sharpening your instrument, sensitivity, compassion and healing skill set. When you take joy in your work and with care keep rubbing it, shining it, it will take care of you for rest of your life

	- Seeing the PRESENCE in action through a case
		- He was sitting across me. I scanned my body and took couple of conscious breaths to calibrate my feeling-listening instrument. I asked him 'so K how is everything?'. He responded to my question with a social answer that fell in the category of formal  'i am good, how are you?'
		- My felt sense of his presence and response was as if he was sitting behind a glass screen and communicating from there. I was not sure if my perception of him was correct or my own conclusion. From that indecisive place I asked him, 'my sense was that something is off today, but maybe it is not so. but i just wanted to share with you to be present here to see you and hear you fully.' He said 'no, all is well'. Then he fell silent for a moment, his gaze softened as if he was looking inside and then he said 'you know, by nature i am a shy and introvert guy, and my responses are often abrupt and raw. But the business in which i am i can't afford to be that straight speaking person. That caused deep hurts to my business and relationships in the past. So now i have adapted to put my best foot forward and be sophisticated in social situations. My inner child withdraws in his shell and the adult me takes charge of the situation. But the bad thing is that even in private space now i find it difficult to be my old self that was playful and jolly. That change has made me more cautious and serious looking person. i truly miss my playful side. Sometimes when my daughter is in her elements, she bring my old self out. That is like an invaluable gift and energises my existence for couple of days. I became the same old playful child who took pleasure in teasing my mom and grandmother and they too loved me for that.'
		- I stepped back and looked at the larger picture of what just unfolded. Now suddenly everything was making sense.
			- At the core, he is playful and childlike. But hides that in a shell to avoid any potential hurt'
			- He is sensitive to the people's behavior and react.
			- His strategy to deal with the things is to 'avoid the critical situation by withdrawing'

				- I began the session with a pause
				- I was resonating with him, not only his words but his whole presence that gave the impression of 'something being off'
				- I gave him the space to lead me to that deeper place where he could touch his animated self - hiding in the shell to not hurt and get hurt.
				- I stepped back from the scene to synthesize the big picture
				- He gave me strong indicators of his stuckness, the method of dealing with critical situations and his sensitivity.
				- The synthesis revealed: withdrawal into shell (SC 1 pattern), sensitivity to others (plant kingdom indicator), adapting to avoid conflict (sycotic miasm). I described this pattern to AI: 'Patient shows SC 1 withdrawal pattern with plant-level sensitivity, adapting behavior to avoid hurt. 
				- AI suggested remedies in SC 1 plant remedies, with Pulsatilla as strongest match given the specific qualities."
			
			

**Priority 2: Write superclass section** (1 hour)

		There are various ways to look at any image. This is true for the homeopathic case taking also. I find Dr Sankaran's superclass concept as an intuitive approach that creates space to leave your all homeopathic knowledge, experience and methods aside, forgetting for a while that you are an expert, and just meet the human in front of you with your human presense. I call this HumanFirst approach. Sankaran gives 6 superclasses in which most human dynamics naturally fit in. Now, i will share brief notes to orient you to this method even if your are not familiar with this till now.



- Explain the 6 archetypal patterns using the chart
- Show how Kapil case demonstrates the approach
- Clarify this as "sensing tool" not memorization

**Priority 3: Differentiation** (30 min)

- One paragraph each: vs. Classical, vs. Sankaran, vs. generic Focusing
- Your unique positioning clear

**Priority 4: Polish what you've started** (30 min)

- Tighten vision/mission
- Add one story to core philosophy

**Total: 3-3.5 hours of focused writing**

That completes Day 1. Then Days 2-7 are content creation (videos, exercises, templates).

## Rest Well

You've built the intellectual architecture. Tomorrow is just articulating what's already clear in your mind. The hard thinking is done.

See you tomorrow when you're fresh.
