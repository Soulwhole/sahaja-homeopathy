---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Program Name:** Sahaja Homeopathy - The Felt Sense Method

**Tagline (FINAL):** 
"Where Unprejudiced Presence Meets AI-Augmented Precision"

**Core Innovation:** 
First homeopathy program that systematically teaches presence/perception as trained skill (via Focusing methodology) before pattern recognition, partnered with AI for remedy precision.

**Target Audience:** 
Homeopathic interns (primary), experienced practitioners seeking to deepen perceptual skills (secondary)

**Duration:** 9 months

**Format:** Online, weekly live supervision, self-paced modules

---

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS (Finalized)

### Three Pillars:
1. **PRESENCE First** - Daily Focusing practice before pattern recognition
2. **HumanFirst** - Connect with person behind symptoms
3. **AI-Synergy** - Partner with AI for pattern processing

### Critical Language Developed:
- "Sahaja makes unprejudiced observation a **trained skill, not hoped-for osmosis**" ← This phrase is gold
- "Perception first, knowledge second"
- "Presence as practical competency"
- "The instrument of perception"
- "Therapeutic regardless of whether they find perfect similimum"

### Competitive Positioning:
- **vs. Classical:** We teach presence first, not technique first
- **vs. Sankaran's Method:** Start from 7th level (presence), not progressive stages
- **vs. Gurukuls:** Systematic training in 9 months vs. multi-year osmosis
- **vs. PEM (Gandhi):** Wholeness through felt sense before AI integrates classifications, not classification-first analysis
- **Compatible with ALL methods** - Sahaja is foundational skill layer, not competing system

## PRICING STRATEGY (Decided)

### Beta Cohort (First 8-10 students):
- ₹45,000-50,000 for 9 months

### Regular Cohorts (Future):
- Initial: ₹75,000-90,000

### Market Context:
- Competitors: ₹50-110k tuition PLUS ₹50k-1.4L in travel/accommodation

## 10 PRACTICE CASES GENERATED

**Status:** First draft complete, needs your review/editing for authenticity

**Coverage:**
- SC 1: Cases 1-2 (Plant/Mineral)

2. Add your clinical wisdom commentary
3. We refine AI prompts for future case generation
4. Create teaching exercises/questions for each case

## KEY INSIGHTS & DECISIONS

### Focusing Integration:
**Dual function identified:**
1. **Therapeutic:** Process itself initiates healing (patients shift before remedy)
2. **Diagnostic:** Makes implicit pattern explicit for AI analysis

**Why name Focusing explicitly:**
- Research credibility (decades of psychotherapy outcomes)
- Distinguishes from vague "empathetic listening"
- Honors Gendlin's systematic development
- Bridges homeopathy to existential philosophy/body-centered therapy

### Teaching Philosophy:
**"In case presentations, we discuss therapeutic process before naming remedy."**

Students learn HOW healing happens, not WHICH remedy cured. Remedy identification comes last—technical footnote to human encounter. This trains practitioners who are therapeutic regardless of perfect similimum.

### Market Positioning Against Gurukuls:
**Respect + Differentiate:** "Several prestigious gurukul programs offer multi-year apprenticeships with master homeopaths. We respect this tradition—but recognize its limitation: osmosis is unreliable. Sahaja makes explicit what gurukuls leave implicit."

## IMPORTANT LANGUAGE TO PRESERVE

### From Hahnemann:
"This individualizing examination demands nothing but freedom from prejudice and sound senses, attention in observing and fidelity in tracing the picture of the disease." — Organon Aphorism 83

### From Gendlin (via uploaded document):
"Focusing is a way of paying attention to one's being-in-the-world, one's interaction as it is experienced through the individual (but not separate) body."

### Your Original Phrases:
- "Sahaja = spontaneous, intuitive ease"
- "The felt sense method"
- "Human-First before AI is brought in to integrate"
- "Not a method. It is the foundation of homeopathy."
- "The whispers of vital force can be heard better"

## OBSTACLES IDENTIFIED & ADDRESSED

### Your Resistance Moments (Noted for Future Reference):
1. **Public exposure fear** - Completion exposes you to judgment from Sankaran's community
   - Response: Completion ≠ launch. Can finish privately first.
   
2. **Perfectionism** - Wanting to integrate everything perfectly
   - Response: MVP approach. Start imperfect, iterate based on feedback.
   
3. **Overwhelm** - So much to create
   - Response: AI handles 70% of generation, you curate 30%

### Resource Constraints:
- Solo creator: AI partnership essential
- Time: 8-10 hours/week for content creation is sustainable
- Budget: Start lean (free/low-cost tools), upgrade as revenue comes

## PROJECT VISION (Your Words)

"In 6 months you can be ready to keep the human first and connect with another human being at a deeper level of experience where the whispers of vital force can be heard better than going the traditional way of beginning with materia medicas, repertories and provings."

**The promise:** Transform committed interns into practice-ready practitioners in 9 months by teaching the skill AI cannot replace—unprejudiced observation through embodied presence.
