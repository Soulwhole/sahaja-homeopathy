**Subject:** Day 7: Sensation to the System — Gentle Precision and Your Next Step

---

Hi [Name],

We’ve come far together. You’ve practiced presence, felt-sense listening, witnessing over leading, real-time resets, and responsible naming of the felt-sense with AI as a mirror. Today we’ll turn a responsible name into a clean, humane plan — and show you how to keep learning.

**From Sensation to the System:**

- Keep the name provisional
- Choose a remedy that resonates (by body sense and pattern fit)
- Set a simple, humane follow-up
- Track changes in the patient’s lived experience (not just symptom lists)

**The Clean Plan (Simple Template):**

1) Working hypothesis (plain words):
- "Soft shell; pressed in mornings; softens with safety"

2) Remedy (tentative):
- Name + why it resonates (one sentence)

3) Follow-up window:
- Choose an interval that matches case tempo (e.g., 2–4 weeks)

4) What we’ll track:
- Connection and aliveness
- Frequency/intensity of key experiences (pressed, fold-in)
- Spontaneous returns of previously blocked parts

5) If-then adjustments (lightweight):
- If nothing moves, re-check the name (did we lead?)
- If partial shift, consider potency/interval
- If new pattern emerges, revise the name first, then remedy

**Collaboration:**

- Share the plan in plain language; invite correction
- Make the follow-up a joint inquiry: "What will you notice when things ease?"
- Keep the tone benevolent and flexible

**Today's Practice:**

- Take your Day 6 synthesis and write a 4-part clean plan (hypothesis → remedy → follow-up window → what you’ll track)
- Say it aloud in plain language; remove jargon
- Optional: run a brief AI mirror check on the plan; keep only what resonates

**The Deeper Truth:**

Gentle precision comes from presence. The plan is an expression of relationship, not control. We act lightly, observe honestly, and adjust together.

**Your Next Step — Continue the Journey:**

If this 7-day experience resonated, here are ways to keep deepening (choose what fits now):

- Sahaja Essentials (₹499–999/month):
  - 2 fresh cases monthly
  - AI prompt library access
  - Community reflections and Q&A

- 3-Month Focusing Intensive (₹15,000–25,000):
  - Weekly 1:1 Focusing sessions
  - Custom presence practices
  - Credit transferable to the flagship program

- 9-Month Flagship Program (₹45,000–90,000):
  - Presence-first training with supervision
  - Case Taking Gym + AI synergy
  - Alumni access to Essentials included

Choose the path that suits your readiness. Presence grows with practice.

**Thank You:**

It’s been an honor to walk with you. If you reply to this email with one sentence — "What changed in your listening?" — I’ll personally read it.

Warmly,
[Your name]
