**Subject:** Day 6: Naming Patterns Responsibly — Let Felt Sense Lead, Let AI Mirror

---

Hi [Name],

Yesterday we practiced catching ourselves in real time and resetting from leading to witnessing. Today, we’ll learn to name patterns responsibly — sensing superclass/kingdom/family/miasm without leading the patient, and using AI as a reflective mirror (not as the driver).

**Responsible Pattern Naming:**

- Sense first, name later — let your felt resonance lead.
- Speak tentatively — names are provisional and correctable.
- Keep language plain — translate to taxonomy only after it fits.
- Use AI to mirror back possibilities — then re-check in your body.

**Mini-Examples (Plain → Tentative → Invite → Mirror):**

Plain felt sense: "Withdraws into shell, softens when safe."
Tentative naming: "Feels like a soft shell pattern… does that fit?"
Invite correction: "If not ‘soft shell’, what word feels closer?"
AI mirror (after session): "Summarize neutrally, de-identified; ask for 2–3 resonant superclass/kingdom/family/miasm possibilities; re-check in your body."

**The Two-Step Naming Practice:**

1) Human (during/after session):
- Write a 2–3 line felt-sense synthesis in plain language (no jargon).
- Keep it specific, relational, embodied.

2) AI Mirror (after session):
- Paste the synthesis (de-identified) to AI and request:
  - "Offer 2–3 resonant hypotheses across superclass/kingdom/family/miasm, with short reasons, in plain language."
- Re-check suggestions in your body; keep only what resonates.
- Keep it provisional: "Perhaps… we’ll see if this holds."

**What Responsible Naming Sounds Like (in-session):**

- "As you say ‘pressed’, your shoulders draw in — I’m sensing a ‘pressed, fold-in’ kind of pattern. Does that feel right, or is there another word?"
- "Part of me wonders about a ‘soft shell’ feel — I’m not attached; tell me if it’s off."
- "Let’s keep it as a ‘perhaps’ and see what returns on its own."

**Collaboration:**

- Name tentatively, invite their sense: "Does that word fit in your body?"
- Share the process: "After we finish, I’ll use an AI mirror to see what aligns. We’ll keep only what you and I both feel is true."
- Privilege lived experience over tidy theory; correct transparently.

**Pitfalls and Fixes:**

- Pitfall: Forcing a category early. Fix: Keep it as a "perhaps"; wait for it to return.
- Pitfall: Overfitting to AI output. Fix: Re-check in your body; drop what doesn’t resonate.
- Pitfall: Jargon too soon. Fix: Plain speech first; translate later.

**Today's Practice:**

- Write one 2–3 line plain-language synthesis from a patient or a case video.
- Ask AI for 2–3 resonant possibilities (superclass/kingdom/family/miasm) in simple terms.
- Re-check in your body; mark one as "tentative." Journal why it resonates.

**The Deeper Truth:**

Patterns emerge from relationship and presence. Categories help only when they reflect lived experience. Sense first; name later; verify by resonance.

**Tomorrow:** We’ll turn a responsible name into a clean plan — precise prescription and a simple, humane follow-up.

Warmly,
[Your name]

## **Lead Magnet: "Responsible Naming Cheat Sheet"**

**Contents:**
- Flow: Felt sense → Tentative phrase → Patient check → AI mirror → Provisional selection
- 10 non-leading sentence stems (plain language)
- De-identification checklist before using AI

---

## **Follow-up Actions**

### **Immediate (Day 6):**
- Send "Responsible Naming Cheat Sheet"
- Prompt: Submit one 2–3 line synthesis to My Sahaja Journey
- Optional: Log AI mirror outputs and what resonated

### **Next Day (Day 7):**
- Reference synthesis + mirror reflections
- Bridge to prescription + follow-up plan
- Encourage continued witnessing-first approach

## **Success Metrics**

- **Open Rate Target:** >25%
- **Cheat Sheet Download Rate:** >70%
- **Synthesis Submission Rate:** >30%
- **AI Mirror Attempt Rate:** >25%

---

## **Key Messages**

- **Sense First:** Felt resonance leads; taxonomy follows.
- **Tentative & Correctable:** Keep names as "perhaps" until confirmed.
- **AI as Mirror:** Supportive reflection, never the master.
- **Plain Speech:** Translate to superclass/kingdom/family/miasm only after fit.

---

## **Integration Points**

- **Day 3:** Intention to sense what’s behind words
- **Day 4:** Witnessing and walking together
- **Day 5:** Real-time reset from leading to witnessing
- **Day 7 Preview:** From responsible name to prescription + follow-up

## **Notes for Implementation**

- **Tone:** Humble, precise, non-technical
- **Language:** Embodied, plain phrases; avoid premature jargon
- **Safety:** De-identify before AI; keep outputs provisional
