**Subject:** Day 2: Creating Unprejudiced Space Before the Patient Enters

---

Hi [Name],

Yesterday we explored why unprejudiced observation gets lip service. Today, let's address the deeper question: How do we actually create unprejudiced space?

**Hahnemann's Wisdom:**

Aphorism 6: "The unprejudiced observer... knows nothing of what is to be expected from the disease."

Aphorism 83: "The individualizing examination demands nothing but freedom from prejudice and sound senses, attention in observing and fidelity in tracing the picture of the disease."

Hahnemann knew the mind's default mode was the enemy of clear perception.

**The Prejudice Problem:**

Your mind operates on autopilot—drawing from a vast library of past experiences, beliefs, and biases. This isn't wrong, but it clouds your listening, seeing, and perception.

When you're caught in thought, your patient's subtle symptoms get filtered through your mental noise.

**The Freedom Path:**

The first step is awareness: "What is the quality of my listening when I'm thinking?"

The second step is experiential release: creating space between stimulus and response.

**Why This Matters:**

When you create this space, something remarkable happens: you start hearing what you couldn't hear before. Patients' subtle symptoms become clearer. Your own intuition becomes more reliable. The case begins to make sense in ways that surprise you.

**Addressing Your Concerns:**

*Maybe you feel that you don't have time.* Fact is, if you prioritize even few minutes a day of complete silence, you will be more efficient and will have time for life, relationships, and creativity.

*Maybe you feel this is a spiritual exercise and I'm not that sort of person.* Rest assured, it will not change your spiritual orientation. Be ready to be a better version of what you strive to be.

**The Experiment:**

Try this simple test: Notice the difference in your listening quality when you're thinking vs. when you're present. You'll feel the difference immediately.

**Today's Practice:**

The 5-minute breathing exercise "Begin with Breath" (audio attached). You can't mend the roof when it's raining—create this space before your day begins.

  **The Simple Test:**
After breathing, notice: How does your body feel? What's the quality of your attention? You'll feel more grounded, more present. That's the space where better listening happens.

**Timing:**
- A ritual before your patients enter is good
- But the best is when you have it as part of your day
- One time a day is good, two times is better, three times a day is best

**Additional Resources:**

Breathing exercises and other practices can be found on our website. More personalized resources are available there.

**Your Journey Continues:**

Track your experience in My Sahaja Journey. Notice what you notice.

**Tomorrow:** We'll learn to feel what's beneath words.

Warmly,
[Your name]
