**Subject:** Day 3: What Patients Really Want to Say (But Can't Find Words For)

---

Hi [Name],

Yesterday we learned to create unprejudiced space through breathing practice. Today, we discover what happens when you enter that space with a different intention.

**The Surface vs. The Real Thing:**

J. Krishnamurti said: "Description is not the thing."

Words are surface phenomena. The real thing is subtle, often vague, hiding, not-yet-here, fuzzy. But we all know there's a deeper meaning we're trying to express through language—both verbal and body language.

By default, descriptions are louder and more vivid. They grab our attention. The real thing whispers.

**The Intention That Changes Everything:**

Once you realize this as a homeopath, you enter the session with a different intention: to get the thing behind the words.

The intention sets the encounter.

**The Question That Opens Doors:**

I'm always curious and ask, both inside and out loud: "So what is it that you want to say that I'm not getting?"

This opens a door that usually remains locked.

**What Happens Next:**

Meaning behind the words starts flowing—first slowly and hesitantly. But if you create the right space, the excavation activity has surprising returns: you can hit the gold pot.

**Today's Practice:**

Try this with your next patient. Before they speak, set the intention: "I want to sense what's behind their words." Then ask: "What is it that you want to say that I'm not getting?"

Notice what happens.

**Your Case Taking Gym:**

Practice this skill with our AI simulations—your personal "case taking gym" where you can develop this felt-sense perception safely. Experiment with your relating spectrum with an eye of transcendence.

**Additional Resources:**

- Video demonstration of intention-setting
- Text guide on identifying safe playgrounds for experimentation
- Practice scenarios for different patient types

**Your Journey Continues:**

Track your experience in My Sahaja Journey. What doors opened?

**Tomorrow:** We'll learn to recognize patterns through felt sense.

Warmly,
[Your name]
