## Market Analysis

**What you've revealed:**

Competitive landscape in India:

- Week-long intensive: ₹30-50k
- 6-month programs: ₹50-110k
- 1-year fellowship/gurukul: ₹50-110k
- Plus: Travel + boarding (twice monthly to Mumbai)

## Honest Assessment: You're Underpriced

**When you factor in the true cost of competitor programs:**

**Example: 1-year Mumbai fellowship at ₹80,000**

Add:

- Travel (24 trips if twice monthly): ₹40,000-80,000 (depending on location)
- Accommodation (24 weekends): ₹30,000-60,000
- Food and local transport: ₹15,000-25,000

**Total actual cost: ₹1,65,000 - 2,45,000**

**Your 9-month program at ₹90,000: ZERO additional costs**

You're offering comparable duration and arguably superior methodology for **40-60% less** total cost.

## Strategic Pricing Recommendations

### **Option A: Keep Current Pricing (Recommended for Launch)**

**Beta: ₹45-50k** **Regular: ₹75-90k**

**Why this works:**

- Lowers barrier for first cohort
- Builds testimonials and case studies
- Proves model before raising prices
- Positions you as "accessible alternative to expensive Mumbai programs"
- Allows flexibility to raise prices after success

**Market positioning:** "Premium quality at accessible pricing"

---

### **Option B: Raise Regular Pricing (After Beta Success)**

**Beta: ₹45-50k** (as planned) **Regular Cohort 2+: ₹90-120k**

**Justification:**

- 9 months vs. 6 months (50% more time)
- Zero travel/accommodation costs (saves ₹50k-1.4L)
- Unique methodology (Focusing + AI)
- Systematic training vs. osmosis
- Unlimited supervision during program

**Market positioning:** "Equal value to top programs, dramatically lower total cost"

Even at ₹120k, when students calculate true costs, you're still ₹45k-1.25L cheaper than Mumbai alternatives.

---

### **Option C: Tiered Pricing (Future Growth)**

**Foundation Track:** ₹75k (9 months, group supervision only) **Premium Track:** ₹1,20k (9 months, includes monthly 1:1 sessions) **Gurukul Track:** ₹1,80k (12 months, weekly 1:1, intensive mentorship)

This captures different market segments while maintaining accessibility.

## What Your Pricing Communicates

**At ₹45-50k (Beta):** "We're new, building track record, offering exceptional value to early adopters"

**At ₹75-90k (Regular):** "Established quality program, accessible to most graduates, better value than competitors"

**At ₹90-120k (Future):** "Premium training on par with top schools, still dramatically cheaper when total costs considered"

## Value-Based Pricing Framework

**What students actually pay for competitor programs:**

|Program|Tuition|Travel/Board|Total|Duration|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|6-month Mumbai|₹70k|₹40-80k|₹1.1-1.5L|6 months|
|1-year Mumbai|₹90k|₹80-1.5L|₹1.7-2.4L|12 months|
|**Sahaja (current)**|**₹75-90k**|**₹0**|**₹75-90k**|**9 months**|
|**Sahaja (could be)**|**₹90-120k**|**₹0**|**₹90-120k**|**9 months**|

You're offering 9 months for what others charge for 6 months (tuition only), and still far less than total cost of 12-month programs.

₹45-50k for 8-10 students

- Build case studies
- Gather testimonials
- Prove the model
- Create video content from actual teaching

### **Phase 2: Cohort 2 (6 months later)**

₹85-90k for 12-15 students

- Still highly competitive
- Show beta cohort success stories

### **Phase 3: Steady State (Year 2+)**

₹1,00-1,20k for 15-20 students per cohort

- Established reputation
- Alumni network active
- Still significantly cheaper than Mumbai programs when travel factored in

## Marketing the Price

**Don't apologize for pricing. Frame it positively:**

**Instead of:** "Only ₹75,000 for 9 months"

**Say:** "₹75,000 for 9 months of systematic training—with no travel or accommodation costs. Compare this to Mumbai programs where students spend ₹1.5-2.4 lakhs total for similar duration."

**Or:** "What students spend on travel alone to Mumbai programs (₹50k-1.4L), you invest in actual learning. Zero travel costs, maximum access to training."

---

## Payment Plans Make It More Accessible

Even at ₹90k, offer:

- **3 payments:** ₹30k × 3 (Months 0, 3, 6)
- **6 payments:** ₹15k × 6 (Monthly)
- **Early bird discount:** ₹10k off for full payment 30 days before start

This makes ₹90k feel like ₹15k/month rather than huge upfront cost.

## The Honest Answer to Your Question

**"Does this help us price our offering realistically?"**

**Yes, but you've priced conservatively—possibly too conservatively for long-term sustainability.**

**For Beta cohort:** ₹45-50k is perfect. Low risk for students, high value, builds proof.

**For regular cohorts:** ₹75-90k is good, but you could justify ₹90-120k based on:

1. 9-month duration (longer than most 6-month programs)
2. Zero additional costs (vs. ₹50k-1.4L in travel/accommodation)
3. Unique methodology (only program teaching Focusing + AI integration)
4. Systematic training (vs. osmosis-based gurukuls)

**My recommendation:**

- Launch beta at ₹45-50k
- Prove the model
- Raise to ₹90-100k for Cohort 2
- Emphasize total cost savings in marketing
- Offer payment plans to maintain accessibility

You're not just cheaper—you're offering MORE (9 months, AI training, systematic skill development) for LESS (total cost). Own that value proposition.

**Don't compete on price. Compete on value. Then price reflects value.**
