I understand perfectly! You want characteristic dynamics/polarities for each PEM stage, just like Superclasses have their dynamics. Here's my proposal:

**PEM Stage ‚Üí Characteristic Dynamic:**

1. **WOMB** ‚Üí **Inner vs Outer** (merging vs separating from matrix)
2. **INFANT** ‚Üí **Holding vs Releasing** (being held/dropped, grasping/letting go)
3. **TODDLER** ‚Üí **Push vs Pull** (autonomy = pushing away; shame = being pulled back)
4. **PRESCHOOL** ‚Üí **Go vs Stop** (initiative = forward motion; guilt = inhibition)
5. **SCHOOL AGE** ‚Üí **Making vs Breaking** (industry = constructing; inferiority = destroying/failing)
6. **ADOLESCENCE** ‚Üí **Being vs Becoming** (finding identity vs losing self in roles)
7. **EARLY ADULT** ‚Üí **Merging vs Separating** (intimacy = union; isolation = distance)
8. **ADULTHOOD** ‚Üí **Creating vs Consuming** (generativity = producing; stagnation = depleting)
9. **OLD AGE** ‚Üí **Accepting vs Resisting** (integrity = embracing wholeness; despair = fighting completion)

**Questions for refinement:**

- Do these capture the essential tension of each stage?
- Should some be more action-oriented vs state-oriented?
- Do you see different polarities that better express these developmental crises?


**PEM Stage ‚Üí Action Dynamic:**

1. **WOMB** ‚Üí **Absorbing vs Expelling** (taking in nourishment vs pushing out)
2. **INFANT** ‚Üí **Grasping vs Dropping** (reaching for/clinging vs letting go/falling)
3. **TODDLER** ‚Üí **Asserting vs Submitting** (I do it! vs being controlled)
4. **PRESCHOOL** ‚Üí **Initiating vs Stopping** (starting actions vs freezing/inhibiting)
5. **SCHOOL AGE** ‚Üí **Building vs Destroying** (constructing competence vs demolishing efforts)
6. **ADOLESCENCE** ‚Üí **Exploring vs Retreating** (discovering self vs hiding in roles)
7. **EARLY ADULT** ‚Üí **Connecting vs Severing** (forming bonds vs cutting ties)
8. **ADULTHOOD** ‚Üí **Generating vs Depleting** (creating/nurturing vs consuming/exhausting)
9. **OLD AGE** ‚Üí **Integrating vs Fragmenting** (weaving life together vs falling apart)

**Key difference:** These emphasize DOING rather than BEING - the actual movements and actions at each stage.

**Which resonates more for clinical assessment?**

- First set (state-oriented) for understanding the internal experience?
- Second set (action-oriented) for observing external behaviors?
- Or combine both for complete picture?
