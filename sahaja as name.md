## Sahaja Homeopathy - This Works

Sanskrit carries weight in India. "Sahaja" (spontaneous, natural, innate) captures what you're teaching: the patient's natural unfolding when met with presence, not extraction through technique.

**Full name:** Sahaja Homeopathy: The Felt Sense Method **Tagline:** "Natural unfolding through resonant presence"

This positions you uniquely in India while staying accessible.

## The PRESENCE Framework Refined

Based on your clarifications:

**P - PAUSE** (Practitioner's preparation)

- Clear your space, ground in presence
- Before patient, during case when you notice drift

**R - RESONATE** (Attune to patient's being)

- Not just observing - actively sensing WITH them
- Your felt sense of their state
- Body-to-body knowing

**E - EXPLORE** (Compassionate co-traveling)

- Follow their direction with curiosity
- "What got some referencing, were rubbed in whatever little way"
- Not interrogating, but exploring together what wants attention
- Go as far as it goes, notice convergence across life domains

**S - SYNTHESIZE** (Step back, see the pattern)

- Stop, step back, identify "hot window" to zoom in
- State findings to AI for pattern matching
- Not jumping to remedy - seeing the whole first

**E - ELIMINATE** (Perceive obstacles)

- What blocks the vital force?
- Address before, during, or after remedy

**N - NOURISH** (Support vital force)

- Remedy + lifestyle + therapeutic relationship
- Your presence is nourishing

**C - CONTINUE** (Follow-up as process)

- Each follow-up is fresh inquiry
- Pattern tracking over time

**E - EVOLVE** (Reflective practice)

- Your own growth as practitioner
- Student's ongoing learning

This flows better with your actual practice.

## What You're Actually Teaching: The Risky Interaction

The Kapil exchange reveals something crucial:

**You said:** [From your felt sense] "I felt something is off" **He denied:** "No, I'm fine"  
**You stayed with YOUR felt sense:** "Oh, might be I'm getting it wrong but I felt something is off. Is it about something between us?" **He corrected:** "No, might be I'm in professional setting..." **Then it opened:** "I'm shy, abrupt and raw..."

This is NOT a technique. This is:

1. Trusting your felt sense even when patient denies
2. Stating it tentatively, allowing correction
3. Staying curious rather than defensive
4. Using the relationship itself as inquiry space
5. Being willing to be wrong

**The teaching challenge:** How do you teach interns to take these risks without:

- Being intrusive
- Projecting their own stuff
- Damaging trust when they get it wrong
- Confusing their felt sense with their thoughts about the patient

This is advanced therapeutic practice. It requires:

- Deep self-knowledge (knowing your projections vs. actual sensing)
- Comfort with discomfort
- Ability to stay relational when corrected
- Years of Focusing practice typically

**Honest assessment:** What you did with Kapil is probably Month 12-18 skill, not Month 1-6. You can introduce the concept, but mastery takes longer.

## The Real Curriculum Question

You're teaching two things simultaneously:

**1. Focusing skills** (learnable in 6 months to working level)

- Daily practice
- Felt sense access
- Clearing space
- Basic companioning

**2. Therapeutic presence** (takes years to master)

- Reading subtle cues
- Risky reflections from felt sense
- Staying relational through denial
- Using relationship as inquiry

**For 6-month "practice ready":**

Interns can learn:

- ✓ Basic Focusing practice
- ✓ Asking open questions
- ✓ Reflecting back what patient says (simpler version)
- ✓ Using AI for pattern matching
- ✓ Selecting remedy through resonance checking

Interns probably can't yet:

- ✗ Initiate risky interactions from their felt sense reliably
- ✗ Navigate complex relational dynamics
- ✗ Distinguish their projections from actual sensing
- ✗ Recover smoothly when they get it wrong

**The solution:** Teach the foundation (Focusing + basic reflection) in 6 months, then offer advanced training for the sophisticated work you do.

**Two-tier model:**

- **Sahaja Foundation** (6 months): Practice-ready with basic Focusing-based case-taking
- **Sahaja Advanced** (next 6-12 months): The depth work - risky reflections, therapeutic use of relationship, subtle sensing

This is honest about the learning curve while still delivering value in 6 months.

## What "Reflecting Felt Sense Back" Means at Different Levels

**Month 1-2 (Beginner):** "I'm hearing that you feel trapped, like there's no way out. Is that right?"

- Reflecting their words back
- Checking accuracy
- Building safety

**Month 3-4 (Developing):** "As you talk about your work situation, I'm noticing you seem to hold your breath. What's that about?"

- Reflecting body observations
- Tentative inquiry
- Staying with their process

**Month 12+ (Advanced - what you do):** "I'm sensing something behind the professional demeanor... like there's a part of you that doesn't feel safe to show up here. Am I tracking something real?"

- Initiating from YOUR felt sense
- Naming what patient hasn't said
- Taking relational risk
- Allowing correction without defensiveness

**The progression matters.** You can't teach Month 12 skills in Month 1. But you can build the foundation.

## Is This Bigger Than Homeopathy?

You said: "Equal. The other side of the coin, therapeutic in its own way."

**What you're describing IS therapy:**

- Focusing-oriented psychotherapy
- Somatic therapy
- Relational therapy

The homeopathic remedy is one intervention within a larger therapeutic encounter. The encounter itself is healing ("therapeutic before remedy chosen").

**This means:**

1. You're teaching therapeutic skills PLUS homeopathy
2. The remedy becomes more precise because relationship creates safety for true state to emerge
3. Students need both skill sets

**Curriculum implication:** Don't hide that you're teaching therapy skills. Name it:

- "This program teaches Focusing-based therapeutic skills for homeopathic practice"
- "You'll learn to create healing encounters, not just prescribe remedies"
- "The case-taking is itself therapeutic"

This actually INCREASES value. Students learn skills applicable beyond homeopathy.

## Day 1 Revised Task

Given these clarifications, here's what to document today:

### 1. Name and Positioning (30 min)

**Sahaja Homeopathy: The Felt Sense Method**

Where natural unfolding meets precise remedy selection through resonant presence.

### 2. Core Philosophy (1 hour)

- Homeopathy as cosmic resonance with vital force stuckness
- 7th level (impersonal presence) as starting point
- Therapeutic encounter creates conditions for unfolding
- Remedy selection emerges from this process

### 3. PRESENCE Framework (2 hours)

Document each letter with:

- What it means
- How to practice it
- Teaching progression (Month 1-2 vs. advanced)
- Common mistakes
- Your teaching stories

### 4. The Two Levels (1 hour)

**Foundation (6 months):**

- Basic Focusing skills
- Simple reflections
- AI partnership
- Remedy selection

**Advanced (ongoing):**

- Risky reflections from felt sense
- Complex relational navigation
- Subtle sensing
- What you do with Kapil

### 5. Teaching Principles from Krishnamurti Gathering (1 hour)

Turn each insight into specific curriculum design choice

### 6. Differentiation (30 min)

How Sahaja differs from:

- Sankaran's levels
- Classical homeopathy
- Other Focusing-oriented approaches

## The Honest Question

Can interns be "practice ready" in 6 months for THIS level of work?

**My assessment:**

- Practice ready for basic Focusing-based case-taking: Yes
- Practice ready for the depth work you do: No, but they'll have the foundation

**The promise you CAN make:** "In 6 months, you'll be able to:

- Take cases from presence rather than interrogation
- Use felt sense to guide inquiry
- Partner with AI for remedy precision
- Create therapeutic encounters
- Begin independent practice with ongoing supervision

You'll have the foundation. Mastery is a lifelong journey."

**This is honest and still valuable.**

Shall we document Sahaja Homeopathy with this realistic scope, or do you want to reconsider the 6-month timeline?
