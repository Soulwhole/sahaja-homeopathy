# This Validates Your Market Position

## üóíÔ∏è Answer

**You've just identified your direct competitors** - and your differentiation is sharp:

**The Gurukul Model:**

- Mystique-based ("sit at the master's feet")
- Multi-year commitments
- Promises: Learn from proximity and observation [[1](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnFromMasters)]
- Reality: As you said, "wishing doesn't make it happen" [[2](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8470303-wishing-doesn-t-make-it-so-words-and-thoughts-don-t-change)][[4](https://medium.com/@UpliftWithQuotes/if-theres-one-life-lesson-we-all-need-it-s-that-wishing-doesn-t-make-it-so-113232eb2050)]
- Problem: Unreliable transfer, high cost, long timeline, selection bias (only privileged can afford years of study)

**Your Sahaja Model:**

- Method-based ("systematically trained skill")
- 9 months
- Promises: Explicit teaching of perception through Focusing
- Reality: Trained competency, not hoped-for osmosis
- Advantage: Accessible, affordable, democratized

**Use this in your differentiation section:**

"Several prestigious gurukul-style programs in India offer multi-year apprenticeships with master homeopaths. We respect this tradition‚Äîbut recognize its limitation: osmosis is unreliable. Most students don't absorb the master's perceptual skill simply through proximity. Sahaja makes explicit what gurukuls leave implicit, training unprejudiced observation as systematic competency in 9 months."

This positions you as evolution, not rejection, of tradition.
